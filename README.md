# Course Overview
The Applied Statistical Methods for Biomedical Informatics course focused on advanced statistical techniques applied to healthcare and biomedical data. Key topics covered during the course include:

Handling Missing Data: Strategies to identify and interpret health data with missing values, ensuring robust analysis and decision-making.

Inferential Statistics: Techniques for inferring and justifying inferences from health data, with a specific focus on diseases and healthcare-related variables.

Phenotypic and Genotypic Data: Methods to correlate and analyze large sets of phenotypic and genotypic data, enabling insights into genetic factors associated with diseases.

Population Modeling: Understanding population dynamics, sampling strategies, and hypothesis testing tailored to specific diseases.

Data from Hospitals and Insurance: Designing and formulating sampling and hypothesis testing methodologies for hospital and insurance data, addressing the complexities of healthcare systems.

Statistical Analysis for Precision Medicine: Selecting and generating regression analysis and other statistical methods for precision medicine applications, providing personalized healthcare insights.

Project Presentation and Communication: Techniques for outlining and formulating paper presentations, ensuring effective communication of statistical findings.

Data Analytics in R: Developing and revising programs to perform data analytics on large, complex datasets using the R programming language.

# Project Overview
As a significant part of the course, a project titled "Predicting the RFFT Score from the PREVED dataset" was conducted. This project involved the following key steps:

Data Exploration: Initial data exploration and visualization in R Studio using ggplot and Plotly libraries. Techniques such as scatterplots and boxplots were employed to identify correlations and patterns within the dataset.

Regression Modeling: Building a multiple linear regression model to predict RFFT (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) scores based on various independent variables, including Age, Education, Smoking, Statins, BMI, and FRS (Framingham Risk Score).

The project aimed to demonstrate proficiency in statistical analysis, data preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation of results within the context of biomedical informatics.

# Key Learnings
Throughout the course and the project, the following key learnings and skills were acquired:

Advanced Statistical Techniques: Gained a deep understanding of statistical methods tailored to healthcare and biomedical data.

Data Visualization: Developed skills in data visualization using R, enabling effective communication of findings.

Regression Analysis: Mastered regression analysis techniques for predicting outcomes based on multiple variables.

Data Preprocessing: Learned strategies for handling missing data and data cleaning to ensure accurate analysis.

Statistical Inference: Gained the ability to make informed inferences from health data, particularly related to diseases.

Communication: Enhanced skills in presenting and communicating statistical findings to a diverse audience.
